## Description

This was a project to get affiliated with node.js. At first *node.js* looked pretty confusing and I wondered why you would ever use it. After completing this I realize that this is a very valuable tool that I will use for the rest of my career. 

The overall point to this project is very useful. You will be creating a generated Readme file with command line and *node.js*. I started out creating an array of objects that included questions so the user can lay out their Readme in an organized fashion. You will be givin proper license badges to go along with it. In another file I wrote out the page using template literals. Also another great concept that I came across during this project.
